## Additional Features

### Statistics Visualization

A statistics visualization page has been added, accessible via the "STATISTICS" button in the navigation bar. This page displays:

- Top queries by request count
- Average request time metrics
- Popular query times

**Note:** This project intentionally does not include database seeders to allow users to interact with the UI and observe statistics updating in "real-time" (every 5 minutes) as they perform searches.

### Theme Customization

A "CHANGE THEME" button has been added to switch between the default theme and a Star Wars-inspired theme for enhanced visual appeal.
